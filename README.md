# Video-Game-Project
We seek to analyze video game sales and how interest in video games has changed over time. This project was completed as a final project for Stats 21 at UCLA. The dataset for this project has been obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings which contains video game data for video games released from 1980 to 2016.

The main goal for this project is to answer the following questions:

1. How has the number of sales in video games changed over time? Do certain video game
genres tend to sell better than other genres? How about the publisher of the video
game, video gameâ€™s platform, and ESRB rating, and Metacritic score?

2. What do top selling video games have in common?

3. Video games are most commonly sold in which continent? Is there a difference in video game interest depending on the region?
